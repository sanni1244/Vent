       CSC 437 – Artificial Intelligence
Two big questions by philosophers
1. How does the human mind work?
2. Can non-humans have minds?

Some philosophers believe that machine can do everything humans can do.

Others have openly opposed this idea. Claiming that such highly sophisticated behaviours such as love, creative discovery and moral choice will always be beyond the scope of any machine.

Intelligent: Ability to understand and learn things.
	Ability to think and understand instead of doing things by instinct or automation.

What is Human intelligence?
1. Thinking
2. Learning and Understanding
3. Knowledge applying
4. Acting (Knowing how to behave in a different environment)
5. Perceiving (the environment)
6. Automated Behaviour***
7. Solving Problem (and making decisions)
8. Pattern Matching and recognition
9. Reasoning
10. Prediction and Inference (Inference is like making judgement based on information gotten/evidence.)
11. Perception
12. Analysis
13. Linguistic Intelligence
14. Creativity, Expressiveness, Curiosity



Intelligent System is
Ability of a system to
- Calculate
- Reason
- Learn from experience
- Solve problems and comprehend complex ideas
- Store and retrieve information from memory
- Use natural language fluently
- Perceive relationships and analogies
- Classify, generalize and adapt to new situations.

Chapter 2: 
	Artificial Intelligence
It means making computer that thinks
Automation of activities we associate with human thinking
	These activities are Decision making, pattern recognition, learning patterns.
Creating machines that perform function that require intelligence when performed by people
***Telling a machine to do something that requires intelligence***

Artificial: Something produced by human effort or art rather than originating naturally.
Intelligence: The ability to acquire knowledge and use it.
So, what is AI?
	The study of ideas that enable computers to the intelligent.
Strong AI vs Weak AI
Strong AI: A robot that is autonomous, thinks for itself and makes its own decisions. Can learn and adapt to new situations and can communicate with humans through the use of language.
Weak AI: It’s used to build a computer program that simulates a particular intelligent activity.
	Ex. Playing chess.
Categories of AI
o Systems that act like humans 	- Behaviour	- Humans
o Systems that act rationally 		- Behaviour	- Rational
o Systems that think like humans	- Thought	-Humans
o Systems that think rationally	- Thought	- Rational

Acting Humanly
What is the Turing Test???
It was created by Alan Turin
	He described the Turin test first in a 1950 paper
	His motivation was to answer the question “Can machines think?”
In this, the system tries to be as indistinguishable from a person as possible. It tries to act like a human and make a third person find it hard to know who’s the human and which is the robot.
Although machines of today now pass the Turin test, and this doesn’t mean it answered the question of if machines can think.
Turin test is the inability to distinguish computer response from human response.

The human interrogator tries to distinguish between the other human and the AI system.
* To conduct this test, we need two people and the machine to be evaluated. 
* One person plays the role of the interrogator, who is in a separate room from the computer system (AI system) and the other person.
*  The interrogator can ask questions of either the person or the computer by typing questions and receiving typed responses. 
* However, the interrogator knows them only as A and B and aims to determine (distinguish) which the person is and which is the machine.  
In order to pass the Turing test, computers would need to be able to possess:
- Natural Language Processing
	To communicate successfully
- Knowledge Representation
	To store information
- Automated Reasoning
	To retrieve and answer questions using the stored information
- Machine Learning
	To adapt to new circumstances






Thinking Humanly
If the program’s input/output and timing behaviour matched with the human behaviours, then we can say that the program is working like the human mind.
Humans are observed from ‘inside’
How humans think: 
	Through Introspection
		Trying to catch thoughts as they go
	Through Psychological experiments
		Observing a person in action
	Through brain imaging
		Observing the brain in action.
Cognition: The mental process of acquiring knowledge and understanding through thoughts, experience and senses.
Cognitive science: A field that aims to understand how the brain and mind function.
GPS- General problem solver- It is a problem solver that always keeps track of the human mind regardless of the right answers.

Think Rationally
Humans are not always rational
Rational means based on reason or logic.

Act Rationally
Rational behaviours: means doing the right thing.
What do we mean by the right thing: That which is expected to maximize goal achievement.
When AI acts rationally
Advantage
- It is more general than using logic
	It is Logic + Domain Knowledge
- It allows extension of the approach with more scientific methodologies
Rational Agent
	Agent: An agent is an entity that perceives and acts.
For any given class of environment and tasks, we seek the agent with the best performance.
***Computational limitations make perfect rationality unachievable***

AI has two major roles:
- Study the intelligent part concerned with humans
- Represent those actions using computers

Rational behaviour may not involve rational thinking
		**Reflex action
Goals of AI
	-To make computers more useful by making them take over dangerous and tedious tasks.
	-To understand the principles of AI
Academic Disciplines that are important to AI
- Philosophy – Helps understand how humans think.
- Mathematics – formalizes three main areas of AI: computation, logic, probability.
- Economics: Decision theory, utility.
- Neuroscience: Neurons as information processing units.
- Computer Engineering: Building fast and efficient computers.
- Control Theory: Design systems that maximize an objective function over time.
			How can artifacts operate under their own control?
- Psychology/Cognitive Science: How do humans think and act?
				The study of human reasoning
				How do people behave, process info, represent knowledge?
- Linguistics: Knowledge representation, grammar. For understanding natural languages.

Problem Solving
	In order to automatically solve a problem using AI.

We need representation of the problem (Formalization)
Algorithms that use some strategy to solve the problem (Searching technique).

Problem Formulation:
	The process of deciding what sort of action to consider, given a goal.

Goal Formulation:
	It is the first step in problem solving
	Creating a goal
	
Searching strategies for AI
	
1. Informed (Heuristic Search)
- Best First Search
o A*search
- Hill Climbing
- Constraint Satisfaction
2. Un-informed (Blind Search)
- Depth first search
o Deep Limited
* Iterative Deepening
- Breadth first
- Cost-first

Search Strategy
	Search is the systematic examination of states to find path from start to the goal.
