<h2>WHAT IS AN OPERATING SYSTEM? </h2>
It is hard to pin down what an operating system is other than saying it is the
software that runs in kernel mode—and even that is not always true. Part of the
problem is that operating systems perform two basically unrelated functions: providing application programmers (and application programs, naturally) a clean
abstract set of resources instead of the messy hardware ones and managing these hardware resources. Depending on who is doing the talking, you might hear
mostly about one function or the other. Let us now look at both. <br/><br/>
<h3>The Operating System as an Extended Machine </h3>
<p>The architecture (instruction set, memory organization, I/O, and bus structure) of most computers at the machine language level is primitive and awkward
to program, especially for input/output. To make this point more concrete, consider how floppy disk I/O is done using the NEC PD765 compatible controller
chips used on most Intel-based personal computers. (Throughout this book we
will use the terms "floppy disk" and "diskette" interchangeably.) We use the
floppy disk as an example, because, although it is obsolete, it is much simpler
than a modern hard disk. The PD765 has 16 commands, each specified by loading
between I and 9 bytes into a device register. These commands are for reading and
writing data, moving the disk arm, and formatting tracks, as well as initializing,
sensing, resetting, and recalibrating the controller and the drives.</p>

<h3>HISTORY OF OPERATING SYSTEMS</h3>
Operating systems have been evolving through the years. In the following
sections we will briefly look at a few of the highlights. Since operating systems
have historically been closely tied to the architecture of the computers on which
they run, we will look at successive generations of computers to see what their operating systems were like. This mapping of operating system generations to computer generations is crude, but it does provide some structure where there would
otherwise be none.
The progression given below is largely chronological, but it has been a bumpy
ride. Each development did not wait until the previous one nicely finished before
getting started. There was a lot of overlap, not to mention many false starts and
dead ends. Take this as a guide, not as the last word.
The first true digital computer was designed by the English mathematician
Charles Babbage (1792-1871).<br/> Although Babbage spent most of his life and fortune trying to build his "analytical engine," he never got it working properly because it was purely mechanical, and the technology of his day could not produce
the required wheels, gears, and cogs to the high precision that he needed. Needless to say, the analytical engine did not have an operating system.
As an interesting historical aside, Babbage realized that he would need software for his analytical engine, so he hired a young woman named Ada Lovelace,
who was the daughter of the famed British poet Lord Byron, as the world's first
programmer. The programming language Ada® is named after her.

<h1>Note 2</h1>
<p>An operating system, or OS, is the software that manages the hardware and software resources of a computer. It acts as an intermediary between the computer's user and the hardware, allowing the user to interact with the computer in a graphical user interface (GUI) rather than having to communicate directly with the hardware.</p><br/>
<p>There are several types of operating systems, including single-user and multi-user, as well as single-tasking and multi-tasking. Single-user operating systems are designed to be used by one person at a time, while multi-user operating systems allow multiple users to access the computer simultaneously. Single-tasking operating systems can only run one program at a time, while multi-tasking operating systems can run multiple programs simultaneously.</p><br/>
<p>One of the most popular operating systems is Microsoft Windows. Windows is a multi-user, multi-tasking operating system that is widely used in personal computers, laptops and servers. It is known for its user-friendly interface and its compatibility with a wide range of software and hardware.</p><br/>
<p>Another popular operating system is Linux. Linux is a multi-user, multi-tasking operating system that is widely used in servers, supercomputers and mobile devices. It is known for its stability, security and flexibility. Linux is also an open-source operating system, meaning that the source code is freely available for users to modify and distribute.</p><br/>
<p>Apple's macOS is a popular operating system that is designed to run on Apple's Mac computers. It is known for its sleek design and integration with other Apple products, such as the iPhone and iPad.</p><br/>
<p>The mobile OS like Android and IOS are also widely used. Android is an open-source operating system that is primarily used in mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. It is known for its customization options and its compatibility with a wide range of apps. IOS is the proprietary operating system that runs on Apple's iPhone and iPad devices. It is known for its tight integration with other Apple products and its emphasis on security and privacy.</p><br/>
<p>Operating systems also include device drivers, which are software programs that allow the operating system to communicate with specific hardware devices, such as printers and keyboards. This allows the operating system to access the full range of features and capabilities of the hardware.</p><br/>
<p>In addition to managing hardware and software resources, operating systems also provide a wide range of services, such as file management, memory management, and security. File management allows users to organize and access files stored on the computer, while memory management ensures that the computer's memory is used efficiently. Security features, such as firewalls and virus scanners, help protect the computer from malware and unauthorized access.</p><br/>
