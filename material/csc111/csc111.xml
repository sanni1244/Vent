The hardware refers to the physical components or functional units of a computer which make up the computer configuration <br/>
The design and construction of the hardware of a particular computer is referred to as its architecture or configuration <br/>
The hardware components provide the physical interface to a computer system <br/>

 <h3>Functional Units of a Computer</h3>
The physical parts that make up a computer consists mainly of four basic units, these parts are known as hardware, namely: <br/>
<ol>
- input unit <br/>
- storage unit, <br/>
- Central Processing Unit (CPU) or Processor  <br/>
- output unit. <br/> </ol>
Any hardware device connected to the computer or any part of the computer outside the CPU and the working memory is known as a Peripherals <br/> 
Central Processing unit further includes Arithmetic logic unit and control unit, as shown in the Figure

<h3>Functional Units of a Computer</h3>
A computer performs five major operations or functions irrespective of its size and make. <br/> These are <br/>
<ol>
1. it accepts data or instructions as input, <br/>
2. it stores data and instruction <br/>
3. it processes data as per the instructions, <br/>
4. it controls all operations inside a computer, and <br/>
5. it gives results in the form of output. <br/>
</ol>
